# Crystal Mahjongg

A solitaire mahjongg game written in Crystal Language

## Installation

1. Install Crystal language (version 1.13.1 was used for this but try the latest)
2. open a command line and clone this repo then cd into it
3. ```shards install```
4. ```crystal build src/crystal_mahjongg.cr```

Now run the executable

```./crystal_mahjongg```

## Usage

Click on matching tiles to remove them. You can only remove tiles that are "Free". This means there is no tile above them and they do not have tiles on both the left and right sides of them. They are free if there is just one tile on the left or on the right.  

Tiles "match" if they are identical or if they are in one of the two unique groups of 4 tiles. For the default set used here those unique groups have black squares around their lettering and the lettering is either yellow or black. You can learn more about these tiles from their source site.  https://github.com/jimevins/smooth-tileset

The Linux version lets you use a file chooser to pick a different image source file for the tiles. This game is compatible with the really old Kyodai tile sets that were created by fans of various Dos and Windows mahjong games. Most such Fan Art sites have disappeared but a few remain such as this one. Get some while they are still around!
